A Boy and a Girl

In the Sixth Grade, two eyes met.
Boy and girl, in the hallway.
Then, a push and pull, the crowd moved them.
But, as if in a spell, their eyes didn't stray.

In the Eight grade, Valentine's Day:
The boy, his face as read as a heart,
gave her a letter and some chocolate.
She smiled, and responded with a homemade tart.

In the Ninth grade, a package arrived.
The boy's Mom looked at him.
"And what might this be?"
"A gift for my girlfriend, a skirt with a long trim."

In her house, the girl had a birthday party.
The boy nervously gave her a a gift.
The girl tore it open, her face a grin. Inside was a brand new book, "Adventures at the Cliff."

In the Tenth grade, the girl camped out
at the boy's house, on his birthday.
Then, a girl she didn't know left the house.
The girl followed the stranger.

In the Twelfth grade, the boy came to school.
His face blushing fiercely, he looked at the girl.
The girl smiled mischievously, and motioned for him to spin.
The boy, wearing a skirt, makeup, and a wig did a twirl.

In college, two girls walked hand in hand.
Grinning ear to ear, they looked so deeply
into each other's eyes that it seemed almost murderous,
but intertwined hands told the story plainly.

In a church, two brides approached each other.
Lifting their veils, a kiss to seal a contract.
Looking into their eyes, each said
the whispered opinion, "I love you," now a fact.
